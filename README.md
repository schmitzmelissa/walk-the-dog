# Walk The Dog

A Spark AR Filter.

The main character in this effect is a corgi dog named Archie. When the effect is accessed from the front camera, Archie the corgi jumps on you and whines to go for a walk. The instruction tells you to flip the camera to the back effect. Once the camera is flipped to the back, the corgi idles while an instruction tells you to tap to move. When you tap the screen, Archie the corgi starts a walk animation. The device rotation rotates and scales the corgi asset for a more realistic appearance of the dog in world space. Now you are ready to walk your new spatial pet, Archie, anywhere! Where will you take him?
