## Inspiration

We wanted to create an experience that is fun and engaging, something people would not have thought could be done in Spark AR. Using as many of the core features of Spark AR as we could, our goal was to stretch the limits of what was possible programmatically.

## What it does

The main character in this effect is a corgi breed dog named Archie. When the effect is accessed from the front camera, Archie the corgi jumps on you and whines to go for a walk. The instruction tells you to flip the camera to the back effect. Once the camera is flipped to the back, the corgi idles while an instruction tells you to tap to move. When you tap the screen, Archie the corgi starts a walk animation. The device rotation dynamically rotates and scales the corgi asset for a more realistic appearance of the dog in world space. (He will disappear if you go above the horizon... dogs can't fly!) But watch out; if Archie sees another person, however, he will bark! Fiesty little guy.

Now you are ready to walk your new spatial pet Archie anywhere! Where will you take him?

## How we built it

We used Blender to create certain assets (some were not ultimately used) and Spark AR Studio to put the effect together. The corgi model was purchased on Sketchfab since neither of us are 3D modelers. Melissa and Ryan collaborated from afar between New York and Florida over video chat!

## What's next for Spatial Pets

We're just getting started! Next, we'd like to try some other animals like cats, turtles, fish, or other breeds of dog. Be sure to [follow us on Instagram @spatialpets](https://www.instagram.com/spatialpets/) and be the first to find out when we release our next Spark AR effect!
